Should just need python

	pip install fastapi unicorn 

	pip install requests 

*maybe something else, I've got a preconfigured venv so I dont remember everything that it has. 

start with 

	uvicorn main:app --reload

loads the page on localhost port 8000 or http://localhost:8000

check out the extensions below for free documentation 

	/docs
	/redoc

rename main.py->  to anything else and othermain.py-> main.py and rerun to see a different way of doing the html (I perfer the inital but the latter is nice for small pages)
